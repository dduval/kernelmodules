1) Build the module (on a standard RHEL5 host):

make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/ M=$PWD modules

2) Load it:

insmod reservebuckets.ko areas=16

(where 16 is the number of 4M areas to pre-allocate.

3) Look at the dmesg output and make sure the procfs entry makes sense:

cat /proc/reservebuckets


4) When you need to give some order-10 areas back to the system
(for example to adjust from 16 to 4 areas):

echo 4 > /proc/reservebuckets
